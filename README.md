# CS370

For this project, I was given the starter code for creating a treasure map game. I was tasked with updating the code to create Q-Training Algorithm. It was supposed to create an intelligent agent and help it learn over time how to efficiently solve pathfinding problems.

This course focused a lot on the AI explosion that has been occurring in the field and the ethical dilemmas that presents to computer scientists. We discussed the hidden bias that can be created by having incomplete data sets. I think this course really helped to illustrate the fine line that we, as developers, walk while trying to explore new technologies. We are all striving to continue progressing forward, but without the right foundation we can end up creating more problems than those we solve.
